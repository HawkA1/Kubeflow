## Overview
This documentation is for anyone trying to build a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) based environment fo machine learning using [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/introduction/).

The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Kubeflow is a platform for data scientists who want to build and experiment with ML pipelines. Kubeflow is also for ML engineers and operational teams who want to deploy ML systems to various environments for development, testing, and production-level serving.

## Cluster environment
For this project environment we used:
- 3 Ubuntu 22.04 Servers. 
- 3 VMs with Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz and 16GB RAM DDR3.
- `Master node IP:` 192.168.1.74
- `Worker node IP:` 192.168.0.169
- `Worker node IP:` 192.168.1.35
